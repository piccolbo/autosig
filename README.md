# Autosig

Autosig allows to create classes that describe signatures of functions.
This allows to:
  - Model functions that share the same signature
  - Model the commonalities between different signatures, e.g. sharing the first few arguments
  - Model common processing normally associated with signatures, such as default values, type checking, validation and conversion, this both at the level of individual arguments and globally for a signature (e.g, check the the first argument is a DataFrame vs. check the that first two arguments are both of the same type)

Since a signature is modeled with class, inheritance can be used to capture commonalities and differences between signatures.


```python
from autosig import autosig, signature, Signature, param



# define a class with @signature decorator inheriting from a subclass of
# Signature (I know, a little redundant)
# x and y are parameters with no special properties
@signature
class BinaryOp(Signature):
    x = param()
    y = param()

# define a parameter with an int annotation, converting to int if necessary)
int_param = param(converter=int, type=int)

# define another signature with two integer parameters, same annotation and
# conversion behavior
@signature
class BinaryIntOp(BinaryOp):
    x = int_param
    y = int_param


# define a binary operator
@autosig(sig=BinaryOp)
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# define a binary operator with int parameters
@autosig(sig=BinaryIntOp)
def int_add(x, y):
    return x + y

add(2, 3) # 5
add(2, "3") # fails
int_add(2, "3") # 5

```
